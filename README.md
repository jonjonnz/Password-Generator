# Password-Generator
Providing a bunch of passwords by using various permutations and combinations of name and date and write them out to a text file .
This can also be used to make account names by altering the code a little.

The output file will contain what inputs were used and how many outputs were created followed by each output in a new line.

Used python3 and tkinter(absolute basics) for gui.

The code is just a bunch of for loops working one after each other to print out many suitable combinations

Couldn't convert the file to exe format coz of windows firewall kept preventing it from running( worked on ubuntu 16.04)
maybe try doing it on ubuntu or linux if needed
